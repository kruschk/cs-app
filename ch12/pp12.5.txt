Either deletion will result in a memory leak.

If line 31 is removed, the new thread will remain joinable, so its
memory resources will not be freed until some thread reaps it with a
call to `pthread_join`. Since no thread explicitly reaps it, these
thread resources will never be freed, resulting in a significant memory
leak from each new thread.

If line 32 is removed, `sizeof int` bytes will leak each time a new
thread is spooled.
