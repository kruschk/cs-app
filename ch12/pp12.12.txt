This function is implicitly reentrant because it accepts an `unsigned
int *`. If a pointer to a shared variable is passed to the procedure, it
loses its reentrancy (by definition, reentrant functions do not share
data between threads). As long as the provided argument is not shared,
the procedure maintains its reentrancy, hence the term "implicitly
reentrant". If the procedure accepted a plain `unsigned int` rather than
a pointer, it would be explicitly reentrant, rendering this
consideration null and void.
