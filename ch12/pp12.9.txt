A.

The mutex is necessary because the producer and consumer can feasibly
access the same element of the buffer concurrently.

B.

The mutex is unnecessary; since there is only one element, a nonempty buffer is
equivalent to a full buffer, so accesses to the buffer are synchronised
by the `slots` and `items` member semaphores.

C.

The mutex is unnecessary by the same argument as B.
