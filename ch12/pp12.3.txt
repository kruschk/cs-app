Nothing will happen until the server finishes `echo`ing, closes
`connfd`, and repeats the loop. There will be some delay while this
process completes. Once this is done, the program will recognise through
the `select` call that STDIN_FILENO is ready for reading. It will call
`command`, which is programmed to `exit` on EOF. At this point, the
entire program terminates.

Note: the book's solution claims the program will recognise the EOF
state during the call to `echo`, but this doesn't make sense because
they're reading two different file descriptors.
