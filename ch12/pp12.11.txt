Sp = T1 / Tp

Ep = Sp / p = T1 / (p*Tp)

Threads (t)       |     1 |    4 |    8
Cores (p)         |     1 |    4 |    8
------------------+-------+------+-----
Running time (Tp) |    16 |    8 |    4
Speedup (Sp)      |     1 |    2 |    4
Efficiency (Ep)   | 100 % | 50 % | 50 %

Note: the book says the bottom-rightmost entry should be 25 %, but I
don't see how this is possible.
