A.
%rbx: x     = a0
%r15: 1 + x = a1
%r14: 2 + x = a2
%r13: 3 + x = a3
%r12: 4 + x = a4
%rbp: 5 + x = a5

B.
(%rsp): 6 + x = a6
8(%rsp): 7 + x = a7

C.
There are only 6 callee-saved registers available, so the remaining 2 must be
stored on the stack.

Where's a8? Solution makes no mention of it, so it must be an error in the
question.
