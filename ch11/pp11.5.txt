Assume the server has a file descriptor for the connection, `connfd`.
After spawning the child process, the child process will copy file
descriptor table entry `connfd` to standard output with a call to
`dup2(connfd, STDOUT_FILENO)`. The child process will then run the
requested program, and any output written by it to standard output will
be redirected to the connection file descriptor `connfd`.
