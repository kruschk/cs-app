When bit position n is the most significant bit, the bit vector will look
something like the following:

[1111...1110...]
 ^        ^
 n        m
[1111]
[1110]
[1100]
[1000]
[0000]
[0000]

We can see that x << (n + 1) = x << w, where w is the width of the bit vector.
If we shift left as many times as there are bits, this is effectively the same
as clearing every bit (i.e., setting them all to 0), so x << (n + 1) = 0. Form
B can therefore be rewritten as -(x << m). It cannot be simplified any
further.
