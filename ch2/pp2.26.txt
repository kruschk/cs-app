A.
The program will produce an incorrect result whenever the length of string `t`
is greater than that of string `s`, such that the expression on the left
(should) yield a negative value.

B.
Consider the following strings:
s = "test";
t = "string";

In the `strlonger` function, the following expression is evaluated:
strlen(s) - strlen(t)
strlen("test") - strlen("string")
4U - 6U
(-2)U // underflow!
2^32 - 2
4294967296 - 2
4294967294
In this example, the condition is really testing whether `4294967294 > 0`,
which is true. This will always yield an incorrect result unless string `t`
is much, much longer than string `s`.

C.
Simply change the expression to `strlen(s) > strlen(t)`.
