A.
No, the same issue will persist. Despite `asize` being a 64 bit unsigned
number, when passed to `malloc`, it will be truncated to a 32 bit unsigned
number; therefore, the exact same vulnerability will be present.

B.
Using a function such as `tmult_ok`, defined in practice problems 2.35 and
2.36, the vulnerability can be patched by detecting overflow before calling
`malloc`, and taking some appropriate action (such as returning `NULL`) if
it occurs.
