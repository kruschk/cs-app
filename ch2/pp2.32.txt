The given function will yield incorrect results when y = TMin. This is because
-TMin == TMin; therefore, tsub_ok will return tadd_ok(x, TMin), which will
return 0 when x is negative and 1 when x is nonnegative. In fact,
tsub_ok(x, TMin) should return... hang on. I just tested it, and it works
fine. I think the book is wrong; there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with
the function.
