Cache hits and misses will occur in the following pattern:

i | x[i] | y[i]
--+------+-----
0 | Miss | Miss
1 | Hit  | Hit
2 | Hit  | Hit
3 | Hit  | Hit
4 | Miss | Miss
5 | Hit  | Hit
6 | Hit  | Hit
7 | Hit  | Hit

As can be seen, 1/4 references will be cache misses, so 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
will be cache hits. The conflict misses have been eliminated, and the
ones that remain are capacity limits, because the cache block is simply
not large enough to store the working set.
