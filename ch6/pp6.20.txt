A.

As in the previous problems, there will be 2048 reads in total.

B.

This loop accesses memory in a convenient stride-1 reference pattern.
The first reference will miss, triggering a 32 B block to be loaded into
the cache. Seven reads thereafter will hit because they access the
following 7 words that were just loaded into the cache block. The hit
rate is therefore 7 hits to 8 reads, or 0.875. We conclude that out of a
total of 2048 reads, 1792 will hit.

C.

As discussed in part B, the hit rate is 0.875.

D.

Doubling the size of the cache would make no difference, because the
grid is only iterated over one time, and all of the cache misses are
cold misses. Even if it were iterated more than once, a quadrupling of
the cache size would be required to see any benefit, because then the
entire array could be cached. The hit rate would therefore remain the
same at 0.875.
