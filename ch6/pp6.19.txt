Note: the solution to this problem is complete nonsense.

A.

The code performs 1024 iterations, each of which performs 2 reads,
for a total of 2048.

B.

1. Iteration i = 31, j = 31:
   0x1FF8 = 0b0001 1111 1111 1000: grid[31][31].x
   tag = 0b0 0011 = 3, set = 0b11 1111 = 63, block = 0b1 1000 = 24
   Miss, C[63][0] <- [grid[31][28], grid[31][29], grid[31][30], grid[31][31]]
   0x1FFC = 0b0001 1111 1111 1100: grid[31][31].y
   tag = 0b0 0011 = 3, set = 0b11 1111 = 63, block = 0b1 1100 = 28
   Hit!

2. Iteration i = 31, j = 30:
   0x1E08 = 0b0001 1110 0000 1000: grid[30][31].x
   tag = 0b0 0011 = 3, set = 0b11 0000 = 48, block = 0b0 1000 = 8
   Miss, C[48][0] <- [grid[30][28], grid[30][29], grid[30][30], grid[30][31]]
   0x1E0C = 0b0001 1110 0000 1100: grid[30][31].y
   tag = 0b0 0011 = 3, set = 0b11 0000 = 48, block = 0b0 1100 = 12
   Hit!

On each iteration, the first read will miss, and the second will hit,
yielding a total of 1024 hits.

C.

The miss rate will be 1024/2048 = 1/2 = 0.5, so the hit rate will be 1 -
0.5 = 0.5.

D.

Doubling the cache size to 4096 B will make no difference, because the
cache will still be only half the size of the grid array. The cache can
only store half of the array, and whenever the memory references cross
the boundary between the first 4096 B and the second 4096 B, set
collisions will occur, and references to one segment will evict blocks
from the other segment. Unfortunately, since the array will still be
scanned column-wise, equivalent to a stride-256 (byte) reference
pattern, this crossing of boundaries will occur frequently. As a result,
hits and misses will continue to occur in pairs, and there will be no
benefit from loading the blocks on previous scans through the columns.
