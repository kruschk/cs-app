After the calls to `open`, the two file descriptors will point to two
separate file table entries that refer to the same file. The first
`read` call increments the position in the second file table entry
(pointed to by `fd2`). The call to `dup2` redirects `fd1` to `fd2`; in
other words, `fd1` is modified such that it points to `fd2`'s file table
entry, and its original file table entry is marked for removal by the
kernel (because the refcnt drops to 0). The second `read` then reads the
file referred to by `fd1`, but since this file descriptor refers to the
second file table entry, the file position is now set to the second byte
in the file ('o'). This program will therefore print "c = o".
