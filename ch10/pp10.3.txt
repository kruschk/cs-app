The critical point to note in this problem is that the child process
inherits the parent's context, so its file descriptors refer to the same
file table entries that the parent does. The child process reads a
character from the file first, incrementing the position offset in the
opened file. After waiting for the child process to terminate, the
parent reads a character from the file, but this read begins at the
incremented offset (due to the shared file table entry). This program
therefore prints "c = o".
