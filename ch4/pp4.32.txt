The change would result in the following HCL description of d_valA:

word d_valA = [
    D_icode in { ICALL, IJXX } : D_valP; # Use incremented PC
    d_srcA == e_dstE : e_valE; # Forward valE from execute
    d_srcA == M_dstE : M_valE; # Forward valE from memory
    d_srcA == M_dstM : m_valM; # Forward valM from memory
    d_srcA == W_dstM : W_valM; # Forward valM from write back
    d_srcA == W_dstE : W_valE; # Forward valE from write back
    1 : d_rvalA; # Use value read from register file
];

We are interested in the moment when the rrmovq instruction reaches the
decode stage; i.e., on clock cycle 7 (the popq instruction introduces a
load/use data hazard, and therefore a injects bubble into the pipeline).
The pipeline diagram is as follows:

                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
0x000: irmovq $5,%rdx      F D E M W
0x00a: irmovq $0x100,%rsp    F D E M W
0x014: rmmovq %rdx,0(%rsp)     F D E M W
0x016: popq %rsp                 F D E M W
       bubble                      F D E M W
0x018: rrmovq %rsp,%rax              F D E M W
                                       ^

On clock cycle 7, rmmovq is in the write-back stage, popq is in the
memory stage, the bubble is in the execute stage, and rrmovq is in the
decode stage. Since popq %rsp is in the memory stage, both M_dstE and
M_dstM are equal to %rsp. The third case in the HCL description of
d_valA is therefore matched, and M_valE is selected (instead of m_valM,
as it is in the actual PIPE implementation). As a result, the
incremented stack pointer (M_valE) would be passed as an argument to the
rmmovq instruction, which wouldn't be consistent with the convention
defined previously for a popq %rsp insruction (it should store the value
read from memory location 0(%rsp) in %rsp).
