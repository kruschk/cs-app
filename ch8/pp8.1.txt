Consider the following table of the periods during which the processes
run:

Time\Process | A | B | C
-------------+---+---+--
   1         | x |   |
   2         | x | x |
   3         | x | x |
   4         |   | x | x
   5         |   | x | x
   6         |   |   | x

From this table, it is clear which processes operate concurrently.

Process pair | Concurrent?
-------------+------------
AB           | Yes
AC           | No
BC           | Yes
