A.

- Additions:
  This procedure performs `n` additions to decrement the loop variable,
  and another `n` to update the result. We therefore have `2*n` addition
  operations in total.

- Multiplications:
  Using Horner's method, only one multiplication per loop is required,
  yielding a total of n multiplication operations.

B.

The measured CPE of 8.00 results from a critical path containing a
floating-point multiplication (L = 5) and addition (L = 3) operation
within the loop.

C.

Despite requiring fewer multiplication operations, this (Horner's)
method performs worse because it introduces a data dependency between
the multiplication and addition instructions that did not exist before;
i.e., the output of the multiplication instruction is an input to the
addition instruction along the critical path. Essentially, the original
method makes better use of instruction-level parallelism because the
assignments to `result` and to `xpwr` may be computed independently.
